# **KKemployeeSummary**

![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/inquirer)

## **Purpose**

This app is used by software engineering team to generate a command line application. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 

This assignment passes all unit tests. 

When the user has completed building the team, the application automatically creates an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

Following the [common templates for user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates), we can frame this challenge as follows:

```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```
* This app uses the [Inquirer npm package](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.  There is also dependency on path and util npm packages.

* In order to test the program, jest should also be installed.  

* This app runs as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.

To run the file, type **node app.js** in the terminal.
